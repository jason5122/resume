Silo
Create an AI-powered portfolio generator for software developers to showcase their projects succinctly. Implement an algorithm using RAG to summarize a source code repository into a project description. Expand the platform to Columbia and Duke students, and supporting 100+ daily active users.

IBM
Created a weather bot hosted on IBM Cloud using the Watson Assistant and Watson Natural Language Understanding API. Enhanced the error handling feature in Watson Assistant Actions to output detailed error messages. Fixed 200+ backend unit test cases in Node.js and integrated these into the CI/CD pipeline. Created a Python tool to automate logging auditing tickets for production database access.

Google
Completed the entire web development process including writing design docs, implementation, unit testing, and deployment. Used Google Cloud to deploy a fast, responsive web app that supports upwards of 1000+ concurrent users. Created a backend using Java Servlets that implements a REST API to be used by the web app, and tested using JUnit and Mockito test suites. Integrated Google Places API, Maps API, and OAuth API, as well as Google Datastore into the web app.

Undergraduate Research Summer Institute (URSI)
Validated the hypothesis that gene duplication and differentiation affects modularity and evolvability using artificial neural networks. Created a simulation program in Python and C++ using ROS 2 and Gazebo which simulates biological phenomenon such as genotype to phenotype mappings, neuron/sensor connectivity and weights, and fitness landscapes. Ran simulations in parallel using Python in Hopper, a high-performance Linux computing cluster.
